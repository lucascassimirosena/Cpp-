/* Alright if you stumbled upon this file you must be asking yourself WHAT THE HELL DOES 
"The Major System mean". I'll explain you in the following lines and then you can create your own 

 The Major System is nothing more than a memory technique that converts numbers into phonetic sounds.
When we do it we can help our brains to remember them more easily.

For instance, if you were to remember the number 20248321 you would find it more easily if you had
imagined an story in your mind related to that number.

For me these numbers have different meaning, for example:
20 - Nasa
24 - Nero
83 - Game
21 - Net

Nasa invites Nero to play a Game called 'Net'.
20248321.

Why do I think about these meanings when I think about these numbers? Well as I said,
the goal is to turn each number into a phonetic sound, we do it by converting numbers into letters:

0 - "S", "SS"
1 - "T" or "D"
2 - "N"
3 - "M"
4 - "R"
5 - "L"
6 - "CH" , "SH" or "X"
7 - "G" or "K"
8 - "F" or "V"
9 - "P" or "B"

This is these are the basic building blocks of this technique. You can make your own rules.
So here we go. I made the rest of the code just to help myself to remind my Major System. If you're
going to start using this technique I suggest you to create your own. 


After you build the first blocks of your major system, you need to combine the numbers
and give a meaningfull mental picture to it, adding a name to each combination".
The vowels will be used to complete the words.

00 - Susi
01 - Suit
02 - Sun
03 - Sam
04 - Sour
05 - Sole
06 - Sasha
07 - SakÃª
08 - Safe
09 - Soup
10 - Dose

The less abstract your words are, the better, think about real objects or people you know
and try to not put stuff like feelings in your major system because it makes it more difficult to 
remember.

11 - Dodo
12 - Tin
13 - Dome
14 - Door
15 - Tail
16 - Dish
17 - Dog
18 - Dove
19 - Tape
20 - Nasa

I'm going to write my entire system here, create your own, but now you got the idea.
If we're trying to memorize a number like 20140016.

We need to create a story, in this case it'd be:
A Nasa's astronaut opened the Door for Susi and gave her a Dish.
This way after you memorize your whole system, make it easier to remember big sequence of number and
the crazier your story is, the better.
20140016. I just typed it without checking for an answer.
